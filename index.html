    Your BMI suggests you're

    <!-- add range -->. What your BMI result means A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9
    is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may lower
    your chances of experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and
    type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar
    content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for
    regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a
    week. Healthy eating Healthy eating promotes weight control, disease
    prevention, better digestion, immunity, mental clarity, and mood. Regular
    exercise Exercise improves fitness, aids weight control, elevates mood, and
    reduces disease risk, fostering wellness and longevity. Adequate sleep Sleep
    enhances mental clarity, emotional stability, and physical wellness,
    promoting overall restoration and rejuvenation. Limitations of BMI Although
    BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for
    every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes,
    and in certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use. Gender
    The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age.
    Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their
    BMI. Age In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause
    BMI to underestimate body fat content. Muscle BMI may misclassify muscular
    individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't differentiate muscle from
    fat. Pregnancy Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing
    baby. Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise
    health risks for both mother and child. Race Certain health concerns may
    affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at lower BMIs than
    others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your GP or
    practice nurse.
